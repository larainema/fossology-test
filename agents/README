FOSSology Agents directory
==========================
This directory contains the FOSSology agents.

If you want to add an agent:
1.) create a new directory
2.) put your code in it. For an example agent and more hints on writing
    agents see the code and README in the example_wc_agent/ directory.
3.) setup a Makefile that builds and installs your agent using the standard
   make targets and to the standard locations, you can use
   Makefile.template as a template
4.) once it's building and installing properly, add your directory name
   to the DIRS variable in agents/Makefile
5.) PROFIT!!!!
