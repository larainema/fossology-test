End-of-central-directory record:
-------------------------------

  Actual offset of end-of-central-dir record:        1039 (0000040Fh)
  Expected offset of end-of-central-dir record:      1039 (0000040Fh)
  (based on the length of the central directory and its expected offset)

  This zipfile constitutes the sole disk of a single-part archive; its
  central directory contains 3 entries.  The central directory is 175
  (000000AFh) bytes long, and its (expected) offset in bytes from the
  beginning of the zipfile is 864 (00000360h).
