To Whom it May Concern: 
-----------------------

This directory in the FOSSology source tree
(agents/nomos) contains work for a new license analysis agent. At this
point in time, the code is not yet in a form where it can be integrated
with the rest of FOSSology. 

Comments with "CDB" in them are bread crumbs I've left to remind me to
go back and check on that code later (CDB == my initials).



To Do's
-------

- Go back and edit CFLAGS options in Makefile to document and accurately
  represent what is still operable.

- Document all Makefile targets

- Remove all HP_INTERNAL and CUSTOMER_VERSION references.

- Check and remove all unused field of the gl global variable structure.

- Change calls to asyncRemoveDir to forceRemoveDir (make sure it's valid first).


Changes
-------

[This is not at all complete. There have been a lot of changes.]

- Changed ls_t to licSpec_t.
- Changed lic_t to licText_t.


Questions
---------

- Where the hell is checkstrings script? Do we want it?
- SVN_REV #ifdef stolen from other agent code. Where does this get
  #defined?
- Why does nomos set the LANG environment variable?
- Implications of removing custom magic file?
- May want to re-add function validateTools someplace?
- Do we want to keep the Log functionality, but just have the logfile
  be in another place? (Right now, the log stuff has been removed.)
- Do we really need the PROC_TRACE_SWITCH compile #define?


#defines Used
-------------

[Also incomplete.]

BRIEF_LIST
SHOW_LOCATION		Extra code to pinpoint license location. Should
			always be true.
PROC_TRACE
PROC_TRACE_SWITCH	Gives command option for tracing on/off
DEBUG
GLOBAL_DEBUG		Debug access to global variable structure
MEMORY_TRACING		Use Debug Malloc wrapper
STOPWATCH		Performance Measurement
TIMING			Performance Measurement (code has to be added to
places where you want to measure).


Changes made from my nomos_experimental version
-----------------------------------------------

Remove all code #ifdef'd by USE_MMAP
