        extent possible, whether at the time of the initial grant or
        subsequently acquired, any and all of the rights granted

        B. The Initial Contributor hereby grants all Recipients a
        world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to
        third party intellectual property claims, under patent claim(s)
        Licensable by the Initial Contributor that are or would be
        infringed by the making, using, selling, offering for sale,
        having made, importing, exporting, transfer or disposal of such
        Initial Work or any portion thereof. Notwithstanding the
        foregoing, no patent license is granted under this Paragraph B
        by the Initial Contributor: (1) for any code that the Initial
        Contributor deletes from the Initial Work (or any portion
        thereof) distributed by the Initial Contributor prior to such
        distribution; (2) for any Modifications made to the Initial
        Work (or any portion thereof) by any other Person; or (3)
        separate from the Initial Work (or portions thereof)
        distributed or made available by the Initial Contributor.

        C. Effective upon distribution by a Subsequent Contributor to a
        Third Party of any Modifications made by that Subsequent
        Contributor, such Subsequent Contributor hereby grants all
        Recipients a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license,
        subject to third party intellectual property claims, under
        patent claim(s) Licensable by such Subsequent Contributor that

        offering for sale, having made, importing, exporting, transfer
        or disposal of any such Modifications made by that Subsequent
        Contributor alone and/or in combination with its Subsequent
        Work (or portions of such combination) to make, use, sell,
        offer for sale, have made, import, export, transfer and
        otherwise dispose of:

            (1) Modifications made by that Subsequent Contributor (or
            portions thereof); and

            (2) the combination of Modifications made by that
            Subsequent Contributor with its Subsequent Work (or
            portions of such combination);

        (collectively and in each case, the "SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTOR
        VERSION").

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, no patent license is granted
        under this Paragraph C by such Subsequent Contributor: (1) for
        any code that such Subsequent Contributor deletes from the
        Subsequent Contributor Version (or any portion thereof)
        distributed by the Subsequent Contributor prior to such
        distribution; (2) for any Modifications made to the Subsequent
        Contributor Version (or any portion thereof) by any other
        Person; or (3) separate from the Subsequent Contributor Version
        (or portions thereof) distributed or made available by the
        Subsequent Contributor.

        D. Effective upon distribution of any Licensed Work by a
        Distributor to a Third Party, such Distributor hereby grants
        all Recipients a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
        license, subject to third party intellectual property claims,
        under patent claim(s) Licensable by such Distributor that are
        or would be infringed by the making, using, selling, offering
        for sale, having made, importing, exporting, transfer or
        disposal of any such Licensed Work distributed by such
        Distributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made,
        import, export, transfer and otherwise dispose of such Licensed
        Work or portions thereof (collectively and in each case, the
        "DISTRIBUTOR VERSION"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
        patent license is granted under this Paragraph D by such
        Distributor: (1) for any code that such Distributor deletes
        from the Distributor Version (or any portion thereof)
        distributed by the Distributor prior to such distribution; (2)
        for any Modifications made to the Distributor Version (or any
        portion thereof) by any other Person; or (3) separate from the
        Distributor Version (or portions thereof) distributed or made
        available by the Distributor.

        E. If Recipient institutes patent litigation against another
        Recipient (a "USER") with respect to a patent applicable to a
        computer program or software (including a cross-claim or
        counterclaim in a lawsuit, and whether or not any of the patent
        claims are directed to a system, method, process, apparatus,
        device, product, article of manufacture or any other form of
        patent claim), then any patent or copyright license granted by
        that User to such Recipient under this License or any other
        copy of this License shall terminate. The termination shall be
        effective ninety (90) days after notice of termination from
        User to Recipient, unless the Recipient withdraws the patent
        litigation claim before the end of the ninety (90) day period.
        To be effective, any such notice of license termination must
        include a specific list of applicable patents and/or a copy of
        the copyrighted work of User that User alleges will be
        infringed by Recipient upon License termination. License
        termination is only effective with respect to patents and/or
        copyrights for which proper notice has been given.
