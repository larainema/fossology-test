\maketitle

We would like to create a tool that can locate and parse the copyright statements from any file. This is important when no license information is present in a package or when one wants to track contributers in open source. The method proposed in the following document uses a simple set of regular expressions (RegEx's) and a naive Bayes algorithm to locate sections of text that have high probabilities of being copyright statements.

\section{Emails URLs and everything RegEx...}
We can use regular expressions to grab a lot of information including email addresses, URLs, file paths, dates, times, and copyright symbols. We use the following regex's to gather these pieces of information.

\subsection{Email RegEx}
$EMAIL = REGEX\{'([A-Za-z0-9-\_.+]+@[A-Za-z0-9-\_.+]+.[A-Za-z]+)'\}$
\subsection{URL RegEx}
$URL = REGEX\{'([A-Za-z0-9]+://[A-Za-z0-9/\#\&?.+\_]*|www[A-Za-z0-9/\#\&?.+\_]*)'\}$

\section{Learning a model of copyright statements}

\subsection{Training data}
We wrap each copyright holder with $<s>...</s>$ tags. 

EXAMPLE:
\quote{
APACHE2-MPM-ITK:\\
\\
apache2-mpm-itk is copyright $<s>$Steinar H. Gunderson $<$sgunderson@bigfoot.com$>$\\
and Knut Auvor Grythe $<$knut@auvor.no$>$ $</s>$, and is provided under the same license\\
as the Apache web server.\\
}

\subsection{The model, as it stands}

Example data: ``is copyright Steinar'',\\
 where $word_{i-2} =$ `is', $word_{i-1} =$ `copyright', and $word_{i} =$ `Steinar'

To locate the beginning of the copyright statement we compare two probabilities. First the probability of seeing $word_{i-2}, word_{i-1}, and \ word_{i}$ vs. $word_{i-2}, word_{i-1}, and \ START$, or if (1) is TRUE then we have found the start of a copyright holder.
\begin{equation}
P(word_{i-2}, word_{i-1}, and START)
> P(word_{i-2}, word_{i-1}, and word_{i})
\end{equation}

Once the algorithm has found the beginning of a copyright holder it continues for a set number of tokens. If another copyright holder is found the counter is reset and the algorithm continues until the counter gets to zero and no other copyright holders are found. Many time the algorithm grabs text past the end of the copyright statement, a side effect of the counter method. With a slight modification we can transform Equation (1) into Equation (2) and try to locate the end of the copyright statement, and stop the counter early. This so far tends to cut the statement short on longer copyright statements.

$P(END, word_{i+1}, word_{i+2}) + I_{word_{i} = CAPPED} P(word_{i} not a copyright holder)$ \\
$> P(word_{i}, word_{i+1}, word_{i+2}) + I_{word_{i} = CAPPED} P(word_{i} is a copyright holder)$
\begin{equation}
\end{equation}
