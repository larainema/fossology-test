    Performance notes:
    The bSAM algorithm is slow.  In order to speed it up, it has been
    divided into specific tasks.
    - filter_license: convert files to tokens for comparison.
    - license: use bSAM to compare tokenized files.
    - filter_clean: remove tokenized files that are no longer needed.
    The SQL for each of these steps does not scale well.
    In particular, finding all pfiles to process takes longer and longer
    as the pfile and ufile tables grow.
    Since the list of all pfiles is needed for each of the three
    processing stages, two more stages are being introduced:
    - sqlagent: Create a temporary table containing the pfile list.
    This reduces the need to determine the list every time.
    - filter_license: convert files to tokens for comparison.
    - license: use bSAM to compare tokenized files.
    - filter_clean: remove tokenized files that are no longer needed.
    - sqlagent: Remove the temporary database table.
    While the first sqlagent command may be time-consuming, the
    remaining steps should be much faster.

    The scheduler uses a greedy algorithm to identify which jobs to run.
    Jobs are segmented into groups of tasks (right now, 5000 tasks per
    segment).  A segment does not end (and the next does not start) until
    all of the tasks complete.
    The best case has the largest jobs run first, so they will complete as
    soon as possible.  Meanwhile parallel tasks will start later and
    (hopefully) finish earlier.
    (In the worst case, everything will take a long time.)
    Thus: records are sorted by size.  NOTE: This is the original file
    size and not the tokenized file size.  But it should be good enough
    for a greedy algorithm.
