FOSSology is a framework for software analysis tools. The current tools identify licenses in software, allow browsing uploaded file hierarchies, and extracts MIME type and meta data information.

<H1>FOSSology's Graphical User Interface</H1>
This website is an interface into the FOSSology project. With it, you can:
<ul>
<li>Upload files to analyze.";
	if (@$_SESSION['UserLevel'] < PLUGIN_DB_UPLOAD)
	  {
	  $V .= " (Login access required.)";
	  }
	$V .= "
<li>Unpack and store the data within the files for analysis.
<li>Invoke specialized agents to scan and analyze the files.";
	if (@$_SESSION['UserLevel'] < PLUGIN_DB_ANALYZE)
	  {
	  $V .= " (Login access required.)";
	  }
	$V .= "
<li>Store and display the analyzed results.
</ul>

<H1>How to Begin.....</H1>
The menu at the top contains all the primary capabilities of FOSSology.
<ul>
<li><b>Browse</b>: If you don't know where to start, try browsing the currently uploaded projects.
<li><b>Search</b>: Look through the uploaded projects for specific files.
<li><b>Login</b>: Depending on your account's access rights, you may be able to upload files, schedule analysis tasks, or even add new users.
</ul>
