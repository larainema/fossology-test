Package: fossology
Architecture: all
Depends: fossology-scheduler, fossology-web
Description: open and modular architecture for analyzing software
 A web based tool that allows you to upload software to be picked apart
 and then analyzed by software agents which produce results that are
 then browsable via the web interface. Existing agents include license
 analysis, metadata extraction, and MIME type identification.
 .
 This metapackage ensures that the fossology component packages needed
 for a single-system install are installed in the right order. For a
 multi-system install, consult the README.Debian file included in the
 fossology-common package.
