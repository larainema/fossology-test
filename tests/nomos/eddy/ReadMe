How to Run Nomos/Gnmos license comparisons

Last updated: Tue Mar  2 11:18:39 PST 2010

Overview
========

The fo-nomosLicenseTest program can process a single file (-f) or a complete 
directory of directories like the eddy test files (-d).


Standard Usage
==============

The instructions below are for running the eddy suite:

1. Unpack the eddy tests into a directory
2. On snape, fosstester already has a directory called:

   /home/fosstester/regression/license/eddy/
   
3. To run the tests:
   ./fo-nomosLicenseTest.php -d /home/fosstester/regression/license/eddy/
   
   the output will come to stand out.  So redirect it.
   
Setup and Updating
==================

Setup
-----
- Suite uses a master file created on another system using older version 
of nomos.
- Master file is called: OSRB-nomos-license-matches
- really a symlink to latest results.

The name of the results file doesn't matter.  The name Gnomos has been 
used to differentiate the older version of nomos from the fossology 
version of nomos.  The master file is called: GnomosResults-2009-11-20.

Updating Master file
--------------------

As of this writing gnomos is run on a system called diablo.  IP: 10.74.37.52.
