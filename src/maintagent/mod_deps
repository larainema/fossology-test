# There are no module specific dependencies for this module
# so this script does nothing.
# Since it does nothing, this script doesn't even need to exist, but
# it is here as a placeholder in case this module does have
# module specific install dependencies.  If that is the case, this would
# be a bash (or other) script.  See src/pkgagent/mod_deps for an example.
