This rpm/ directory is meant to contain the files necessary for RPM packaging
of FOSSology for RPM-based systems including RHEL, CentOS, etc.

Initially this will contain the RPM spec file and any other supporting scripts
and may contain additional documentation and utilities as needed.

It is analogous to the debian/ directory, which serves this purpose for Debian
distro packaging.
