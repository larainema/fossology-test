Setting up cp2foss Tests

The steps are automated, but documented here.

As root run the install script to set up the system for testing.

1. make sure the version of cp2foss you want to test is installed in 
   /usr/local/bin/test.cp2foss.  That's the name the tests expect to use.
   
   1.1 make sure test.cp2foss has the following permissions:
   
       -rwxr-xr-- 1 fossy fossy 28724 2008-04-02 15:24 test.cp2foss
   
2. copy to archives in ....cli/test/archives/* to /tmp, that is where the
   tests expect them to be.
